module Theseus
  # A "mask" is, conceptually, a grid of true/false values that corresponds,
  # one-to-one, with the cells of a maze object. For every mask cell that is true,
  # the corresponding cell in a maze may contain passages. For every mask cell that
  # is false, the corresponding maze cell must be blank.
  #
  # Any object may be used as a mask as long as it responds to #height, #width, and
  # #[].
  class Mask
    # Given a string, treat each line as rows and each character as a cell. Every
    # period character (".") will be mapped to +true+, and everything else to +false+.
    # This lets you define simple masks as ASCII art:
    #
    #   mask_string = <<MASK
    #   ..........
    #   .X....XXX.
    #   ..X....XX.

    #   .....X....
